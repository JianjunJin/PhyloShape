## PhyloShape: a 3D model toolkit for morphology evolution analysis (under active development)
Welcome to PhyloShape, an interactive toolkit for 3D model comparisons and ancestral reconstructions for morphology evolution analysis. 

## Features
1. **Color distribution**: provide color profile and spatial color variance from 3D models
2. **Model alignment**: align 3d models to do shape-associated comparative studies
3. **Ancestral reconstruction**: infer ancestral color and shape with the combination of phylogenetic topology
4. **Interactive visualization**: select preferred visualization tools and embed results in powerpoints and papers

## Example
1. simulated dataset
2. previous empirical dataset
3. our own Pedicularis data (but sadly no replicates of each species which is a downside of the ancestral reconstruction.
